### Instructions for Python scripts
1. It is recommended to use a virtual environment. To create it, you use `python3 -m venv .venv` and then activate it by `source .venv/bin/activate`. Note that `.venv` is simply the name for the virtual environment, and you can remove the `.` to make it unhidden.
2. Navigate to specific folder in [Python](Python) where there exist a `requirements.txt` and then run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
3. You can exit the virtual environment by typing `deactivate` or delete it by `rm -rf .venv`
